<p>A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116).
  Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.
  For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.</p>
